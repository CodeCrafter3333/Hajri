GPS based attendance tracking mobile application

## Project Info

**Problem Statement ID** â€“ 1707

**Organization** - GAIL, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas

**Department** - GAIL Limited

**Category** - Software

**Problem Statement Title** - Development of a Geolocation-Based Attendance Tracking Mobile Application.

**Description** - Aim of this App is to enhance
1.	operational efficiency, 
2.	reduce manual attendance tracking errors, and 
3.	provide a seamless experience for employees to manage their work-related movements.

Key Requirements â€“ 

1.	Geolocation-Based Check-In and Check-Out: Automatically record check-in time and geo-location when an employee enters within a 200-meter radius of his office. Record check-out time when the employee leaves the 200-meter radius. Ensure that each check-in is paired with a corresponding check-out, regardless of the frequency of entries and exits.
2.	Manual Location Check-In / Check-Out for Offsite Work: Provide a manual check-in and check-out feature for employees working at locations other than his offices. Automatically suggest relevant locations based on real-time longitude and latitude data, allowing employees to confirm their check-in and check-out at these suggested locations.
3.	Calculate the employees total working hours.
4.	 Data Accuracy and Integrity: Ensure the application maintains accurate and tamper-proof records of all check-in and check-out events. Enable real-time data synchronization and secure storage to prevent data loss and ensure reliability. 
5.	Youtube Link/Video Link (3 Minute video explaining the Problem Statement): https://youtu.be/bmw8unoxA7U
